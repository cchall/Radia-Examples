    "# RADIA Example 5: Iron-Dominated Electromagnet\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates the use of Radia for simulating an iron-dominated\n",
    "dipole electromagnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnetic field at any point in space results from two contributions:\n",
    "one from real sources of magnetic field, such as coils or permanent magnets;\n",
    "and a second from the magnetization of any iron present.\n",
    "Although the iron’s magnetization is induced by the coils or permanent magnets,\n",
    "its field contribution can be much larger than that of the direct contribution\n",
    "from coils and permanent magnets.\n",
    "We call such geometries _iron dominated_.\n",
    "The dipole and quadrupole electromagnets typically used in particle accelerators\n",
    "fall into this category, whereas most undulators and wigglers used as sources of\n",
    "synchrotron radiation do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Field computations in the case of iron-dominated geometries present specific\n",
    "difficulties that usually make them less accurate than those in the case of\n",
    "structures dominated by coils or permanent magnets. Nevertheless, Radia\n",
    "includes special methods that enable one to obtain reasonable precision\n",
    "with a reasonable amount of computational effort—cpu time and memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example presented here is that of a simple dipole steerer:\n",
    "A closed circuit of iron with a small gap has a coil wound around the circuit;\n",
    "and that coil drives flux in the iron (see the graphics below).\n",
    "This example is more sensitive than all the previous examples, and we advise\n",
    "the beginner to gain experience with those earlier examples before diving into\n",
    "this one. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following recommendations will help you achieve an acceptable level\n",
    "of precision within a reasonable time:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Segment the corners of iron circuits as parallel or as perpendicular\n",
    "as possible to lines of magnetic flux. For right-angled corners, one can\n",
    "do this using the circular or ellipsoidal mode of segmentation (see below). \n",
    "Following this recommendation will have a significant impact on your\n",
    "simulations of iron-dominated electromagnets.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the example shown here, we provide (for the sake of comparison)\n",
    "the option to use circular (the default) or square segmentation\n",
    "for the corners. See the function `create_dipole(..)` in the section\n",
    "below entitled **_Define a general function to build a dipole steering magnet_**,\n",
    "and look for the lines containing\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "rad.ObjDivMag(g3, [ncr, nca, n3[1]], 'cyl', typ)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "    and\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "rad.ObjDivMag(g5, [ncr, nca, n5[0]], 'cyl', typ)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a finer segmentation for the iron regions (particularly the pole\n",
    "pieces) closest to the region of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Start with a coarse segmentation and gradually make it finer until\n",
    "the computed field values are stable.\n",
    "Be aware that both memory usage and cpu time tend to increase as the\n",
    "square number of elements (segments) in the iron.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To the greatest extent possible, take advantage of any symmetries\n",
    "present in your system. Doing so saves both memory usage and CPU time.\n",
    "The steering dipole shown in this example has two planes of symmetry,\n",
    "which allow one to reduce the overall problem size by a factor of\n",
    "2$\\,\\times\\,$2. As a consequence, taking advantage of the symmetries\n",
    "in this example means one can cut by a factor of 16 both the memory\n",
    "usage and the cpu time required to reach a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the previous examples, experiment with modifying various\n",
    "parameters and explore how such changes affect the time to solution\n",
    "and the solution itself.\n",
    "Keep in mind that memory usage and cpu time are roughly proportional\n",
    "to the square of the number of sub-elements. This means that increasing\n",
    "the segmentation by a factor of 2 in all three dimensions results in an\n",
    "8-fold increase in the number of sub-elements, and a 64-fold increase\n",
    "in both memory usage and cpu time. As a consequence, it pays to refine\n",
    "the segmentation in some “intelligent” manner. Doing so requires some\n",
    "experience, but the general rule is to concentrate refinements to\n",
    "where it matters most: generally where the field is changing most\n",
    "rapidly—in magnitude or direction—and (especially) closest to regions\n",
    "of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, you might keep track of the precision as you increase\n",
    "the segmentation along one direction and in one object at a time.\n",
    "Following this procedure, you can quickly identify those objects\n",
    "and directions for which refinment yields the most significant\n",
    "improvements to precision.\n",
